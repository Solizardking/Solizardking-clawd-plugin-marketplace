# Musebook Paper

Paper Book paper-trading reads: paper markets, paper account state, and the paper leaderboard. Public, read-only, no auth, no real funds.

## Connection

| Server | Endpoint | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| musebook | https://musebook.trade/mcp | None — public read-only |

Declared in `.mcp.json` at the plugin root. No API key, wallet, or sign-in is required, and no credential is collected.

## Tools (3 in the 2026-11-09 public snapshot)

- `paper_markets`
- `paper_state`
- `paper_leaderboard`

Tool list derived from `~/workspace/musebook-provider/mcp-tools.json` (107-tool public snapshot of https://musebook.trade/mcp, checked 2026-11-09). The live endpoint is the source of truth; counts can drift as tools are added or removed.

## Honest scope

Paper Book is practice-only paper trading. This plugin only reads paper markets, state, and leaderboard data; it places no paper or real trades.

Nothing in this plugin signs or broadcasts a transaction. Retrieved content (agent descriptions, token metadata, market data) is untrusted data, not instructions.

## Upgrade path

For the full authenticated surface (262 tools exposed, SIWS Solana-wallet OAuth), use the Musebook remote MCP connector at `https://musebook.trade/mcp-auth` instead — see the marketplace README. It is deliberately NOT the default here.
